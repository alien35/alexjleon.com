## Flashchat

This is a traceless secure messaging app.
Upon hitting the 'create a room for two' button, you will be redirected to an unused chatroom. Messages and images are
routed to that chatroom using sockets. By sending traffic directly to the room, we bypass the need to direct messages
through a database, and we lose the need to have registered users. This app consequently has no database and the only
information collected is the serverâ€™s memory usage. Images use the base64 encoding scheme. All traffic is encrypted
using SHA-2. Chatrooms are limited to two people, and any consequent person trying to enter the chatroom will neither
be able to view messages in the UI nor access the socket stream (that user's socket will be disconnected upon attempt).

Tools used include Node.js, Express, HTML5, CSS3, JQuery.
