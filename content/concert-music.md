When I was first approached with the idea of writing a work for string trio, I immediately knew the danger that would ensue if I simply wrote a piece for string quartet minus the second violinist. The breadth and depth of sound is vastly different between the string quartet and trio. After experimentation I found a solution to my problem: a tremolo figure seamed throughout the work would help recreate the fourth member of the ensemble.Additionally, the tremolo figure on a string instrument is a sound I deeply cherish, with notable examples in the repertoire like Paganini's sixth Caprice. I challenged myself to work with a very limited amount of material, and the work is largely through-composed due my interest in this particular project to create a sense of perpetual natural flow and continuity. I will note that the climax of the work arrives precisely at the Golden Ratio point--a moment roughly two-thirds into the work--in order to maximize its potential effect and create an overarching naturalistic sense of structure to the composition.


### Rhapsody and Fugue on a Theme (2015) -- Work for solo piano

'What does it [the central theme] mean?' This implausible question served as the impetus of the creation of this work. The theme is transformed and recontextualized in order to dissect it and try to reveal its meaning. The rhapsody is, perhaps, the more passionate context through which the theme is observed. Spiraling massive waves are set against the theme, creating chaos and commotion as the theme rides the inflamed sea. The fugue provides an ascetic cerebral backdrop through which the theme can be more densely transfigured, examined, and re-examined. It is no longer as if watching a grand mythological figure fighting against an unconquerable tempest, but rather peering at at a small microbe through a microscope in a laboratory.

### Lotus Preludes: 24 Preludes for solo piano (2015)

On November 7th, 1940, the Tacoma Narrows Bridge in Washington famously fell due to a gale that was vibrating at the same frequency as the bridge's natural resonance. This coincidence of frequencies caused the bridge to sway at such speed and amplitude that the whole massive structure crashed to the ground. The aggravation of resonance can have powerful effects on nature, and seeking how to harness and exploit it became the impetus to write this set of twenty-four preludes. I applied specific principles in regards to rhythm, contour, and harmony to try and exarcerbate particular natural phenomena that relate to resonance. Imagine sitting on a swing and having someone gently push you. With time, you will rise higher and higher. This is one of the more common metaphors for describing resonance and this notion is re-created compositionally through the concept of rhythmic integrity. Each movement uses two to three sets of short, single beat, rhythmic cells. The different cells are intertwined in such a way as to create variety, but the pulse is always strong such that resonance is always increasing in the same fashion as if you were being pushed on a swing and gradually rising higher. When two waves vibrate at the same or near the same frequency, they will combine to produce a wave whose amplitude is greater than that possessed by either wave originally. This natural phenomenon is known as constructive interference, and was exploited through musical means by maximizing the amount of intervallic consonance in the harmonic material. Consonant intervals produce a greater amount of constructive resonance due to the principal of Coincidence of Partials, a concept related to the relationship of the harmonic series between the pitches, and is explained in detail in Roederer's ground-breaking work 'The Physics and Psychophysics of Music: An Introduction.' In order to maximize the sense of motion, the concept of inertia was applied in the treatment of the contours of the individual musical lines. Lines moving in a direction will continue to do so only to change direction when a significant event in the musical material causes them to do otherwise. Perpetual harmonic destabilization and retonicization is applied with the principle in mind that the ability of any particular harmony to reverberate to its highest potential in the listeners mind becomed dulled with time. Each prelude is kept short in order to last the full length of a listener's attention span. These last three principles relate to psychoacoustics, and are combined with the previous two principles of physical resonance to create a work that intertwines Man, the principles that relate to psychoacoustics, with Nature, the principles that relate to physical resonance. This work, hence, defies the growing public notion that mathematically-conceived scientifically-driven music cannot be beautiful in a non-esoteric fashion. I searched for the beauty and harmony in nature, and laid my findings in this set of twenty-four preludes.

### Una canci√≥n para la luna y el mar (2015) -- Work for guitar quartet

I reflect through this work on the song structure form as well as images of nature like the moon and the sea. This work uses the age-old song structure form of verse-chorus, in this piece repeated three times. That is, however, with a twist. Each iteration of the verse/chorus unit is twice as long as the previous unit, creating an overarching structural proportionality of 1:2:4. Consequentially, each new verse/chorus unit has a greater amount of musical content, and this sense of growing vastness makes me think of the open sea. Additionally, this proportionality can be disconcerting to one's sense of structure. The mind, in search of balance, desires each verse-chorus section to be roughly the same length, but this desire is revoked and a sense of disorientation arises. The effect is maddening, and reminds me of the moon in the poetic, lunatic sense. The verse sections are characterized by recitative-like motifs and quick harmonic shifts. The chorus sections are characterized by dance-like ostinati rhythmic figurations and a slower harmonic motion. The rhythm of the bass line in the verse sections is serialized such that its entrances rigidly alternate between down and up beats, creating a subtle but disconcerting flux that further references the maddening effects of the open sea.

### Castillo en la niebla (2015) -- Work for Large Orchestra

Large brush strokes are used to orchestrate a work that is centrally about structure--harmonic, motivic, and spatial structure. Thus, the 'Castle' is the metaphor for structure, and the 'Mist' is the metaphor for the large-brush-stroke approach to orchestration.

### Color Sketches (2012) -- Work for Piano Trio

I wrote this at the Yellow Barn Music Festival in the summer of 2012. I aimed to capture a variety of emotions and 'colors' through miniature pieces.

### Geometric Night, Three Deer (2012) -- Work for Piano

I finished writing this piece around February of 2012. I came across three deer as I was returning to my house. The gaze of one of them left a deep impression on me, and decided to begin working on the piece that moment. In this piece, I explore the angularity and simplicity of symmetry, as well as thoughts on numerology.
