## About me

Hi there! I'm Alex.

I'm originally from Ecuador and for a number of reasons have had the privilege to live
in wildly different places including Sweden and Costa Rica. I'm currently based in
Evanston, Illinois.


I'm a software developer at NotaryCam, a pioneering online notarization startup, and
music composer for Future History Films, a documentary film company.
