      <description>About me Hi there! I&amp;rsquo;m Alex.
I&amp;rsquo;m originally from Ecuador and for a number of reasons have had the privilege to live in wildly different places including Sweden and Costa Rica. I&amp;rsquo;m currently based in Evanston, Illinois.
I&amp;rsquo;m a software developer at NotaryCam, a pioneering online notarization startup, and music composer for Future History Films, a documentary film company.

      <description>Concert Music Fantasia (2016) &amp;ndash; Work for piano trio  When I was first approached with the idea of writing a work for string trio, I immediately knew the danger that would ensue if I simply wrote a piece for string quartet minus the second violinist.
